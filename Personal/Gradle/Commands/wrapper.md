# gradle wrapper

### Purpose
Creates a Gradle wrapper for the project.  The Gradle wrapper downloads the files specific to the version of Gradle that is being used to build the application and keeps them in the project so that if the application is moved to a new platform, the application can still be run without specifically installing the specific version of Gradle first.

### Example
```
$ gradle wrapper
```
